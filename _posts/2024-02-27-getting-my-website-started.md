I wanted to create a static website to showcase projects I'm working on. I found that a good, free choice is using Jekyll with Github Pages to make it easy to put something online quickly. It took some time to figure out everything, but here it is. 

## Github Pages
I started with [Quickstart for Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)

I also wanted to set it up with Jekyll, so I followed along with [Set up site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)


I finally wanted a custom domain, so I followed [Configure a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages)

## Theme
I wanted to switch to a theme that wasn't the default Minima, so I could at least pretend some uniqueness. I attempted changing the theme in the config file, but that broke the site. So I found a youtube video on how to build a Github Pages site using Jekyll, and Ahmed Tremo was using the theme I wanted to, so I followed along with his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1RYsmOMPLs&t=837s).

## Local Repository 
Ahmed's video showed how to clone locally, and how to push changes through Visual Studio, so that's what I'm using to make posts and pushing. I did find [Jekyll Compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) to quickly make a new post that includes Front Matter. 

## The Future
My goal is to post on here my continuing journey of gaining more knowledge in Cybersecurity, specifically Threat Hunting. I've found some great resources. 

I took the Threat Hunting Course offered through [Active Countermeasures](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/hunt-training/) on February 23.

During this Threat Hunting Training, they mentioned going to ACM's daily malware blog, downloading the PCAP and researching and attempting write-ups.

Faan Ross put out a great course: [Threat Hunting for Beginners: hunting standard dll-injected c2 implants](https://www.faanross.com/posts/course01/)

I want to look into some MITRE ATT&CK training, atomic red team, and more.

I'm excited to learn and grow!
