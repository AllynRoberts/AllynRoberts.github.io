# Note-Taking (Zettelkasten)
#### Zettelkasten is a very different way of taking notes, and takes a lot of dilligence to keep up, and quite a bit of understanding with how the system works. Its main points are you have atomic notes( a note with a single atomic idea) and that note is linked to other similar notes in a chain, so that every note you take is linked to some other note. Some say it's built better for those that want to write books or articles. I've found it to be very useful, especially paired with the PARA method.

- [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) - Project, Area, Resource, Archive - great for organizing notes when more project-based
- [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) - Great for smarter organization and easier-to-use templates, lots of AI integration
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Great Markdown note-taking app, helps avoid bloat of other note-taking apps
